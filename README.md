This is a quickstart tutorial to learn how to us GitHub

Hello, world! My name is Jamie, I am a Junior studying Computer Science with a Digital Arts concentration at UNCW.
This is a practice repository that I created so that I can learn more about how to use GitHub for my DIS course.
I will be using GitHub to work with other people on developing a website that displays research data on sea urchins done by Dr. Warner from the Marine Biology department.
